# What is Radix dApp Toolkit?

Radix dApp Toolkit (RDT) is a TypeScript library that helps facilitate communication with the Radix Wallet and provides an easy-to-use interface over lower level APIs.

The current version only supports desktop browser webapps with requests made via the Radix Wallet Connector browser extension. It is intended to later add support for mobile browser webapps using deep linking with the same essential interface.

**RDT is composed of:**

- **√ Connect Button** – A framework agnostic web component that keeps a minimal internal state and have properties are pushed to it.

- **Tools** – Abstractions over lower level APIs for developers to build their radix dApp at lightning speed.

- **State management** – Handles wallet responses, caching and provides data to √ Connect button.

## Resources

### [Building a dApp frontend](https://docs-babylon.radixdlt.com/main/getting-started-developers/dapp-frontend/start.html)

# Installation

**Using NPM**

```bash
npm install @radixdlt/radix-dapp-toolkit
```

**Using Yarn**

```bash
yarn add @radixdlt/radix-dapp-toolkit
```

# Usage

## Getting started

Add the `<radix-connect-button />` element in your HTML code and instantiate `RadixDappToolkit`.

### Instantiation

```typescript
import { RadixDappToolkit } from '@radixdlt/radix-dapp-toolkit'

const rdt = RadixDappToolkit({
  dAppDefinitionAddress:
    'account_tdx_22_1pz7vywgwz4fq6e4v3aeeu8huamq0ctmsmzltay07vzpqm82mp5',
  networkId: 1,
})
```

**Input**

- **requires** dAppDefinitionAddress - Specifies the dApp that is interacting with the wallet. Used in dApp verification process on the wallet side. [Read more](#setting-up-your-dapp-definition)
- **requires** networkId - Target radix network ID.

## Wallet data

A data requests needs to be sent to the wallet in order to read wallet data.

There are two ways to trigger a data request:

1. By user action in the √ Connect button
2. Programmatically through `walletApi.sendRequest` method

#### Trigger wallet data request programmatically

```typescript
const result = await rdt.walletApi.sendRequest()

if (result.isError()) return handleException()

const walletData = result.value
```

### Change requested data

By default, a data request will ask the wallet for a persona login.

Use `walletApi.setRequestData` together with `DataRequestBuilder` to change the wallet data request.

```typescript
rdt.walletApi.setRequestData(
  DataRequestBuilder.accounts().exactly(1),
  DataRequestBuilder.personaData().fullName().emailAddresses()
)
```

## State changes

Listen to wallet data changes by subscribing to `walletApi.walletData$`.

```typescript
const subscription = rdt.walletApi.walletData$.subscribe((walletData) => {
  doSomethingWithAccounts(walletData.accounts)
})
```

When your dApp is done listening to state changes remember to unsubscribe in order to prevent memory leaks.

```typescript
subscription.unsubscribe()
```

Get the latest wallet data by calling `walletApi.getWalletData()`.

```typescript
const walletData = rdt.walletApi.getWalletData()
```

# Setting up your dApp Definition

A dApp Definition account should be created after you’ve built your dApp’s components and resources, and created a website front end for it. dApp Definition account is a special account on the Radix Network with some metadata set on it that does some nice things, like:

- Provides the necessary unique identifier (the dApp Definition’s address) that the Radix Wallet needs to let users login to your dApp and save sharing preferences for it.

- Defines things like name, description, and icon so the Radix Wallet can inform users what they are interacting with.

- Lets you link together everything associated with your dApp – like websites, resources, and components – so that the Radix Wallet knows what they all belong to.

Creating a dApp Definition for your dApp will provide the necessary information for clients like the Radix Wallet to let users interact with your dApp in a way that is easy, safe, and informative. It also acts as a hub that connects all your dApp pieces together.

You can read more about dApp Definitions [here](https://docs-babylon.radixdlt.com/main/standards/metadata.html#_metadata_for_dapp_verification).

## Setting up a dApp Definition on the Radix Dashboard

1. **Create a new account in the Radix Wallet.** This is the account which we will convert to a dApp Definition account.

2. **Head to the Radix Dashboard’s Manage dApp Definitions page**. This page provides a simple interface to set the metadata on an account to make it a dApp Definition.

3. **Connect your Radix Wallet to the Dashboard** and make sure you share the account that you just created to be a dApp Definition. Select that account on the Dashboard page.

4. **Now check the box for “Set this account as a dApp Definition”, and fill in the name and description you want to use for your dApp.** Later you’ll also be able to specify an icon image, but that’s not ready just yet.

5. **Click “Update”** and an approve transaction should appear in your Radix Wallet. Done!

Provide account address as the the dApp Definition address that you just created, and it will be sent to the Radix Wallet whenever a user connects or receives a transaction from your dApp. The Wallet will then look up that dApp Definition address on the Radix Network, pull the latest metadata, and show it to the user. When a user logins to your dApp, an entry in the wallet’s preferences for your dApp will appear too. Try it out for yourself!

# Data storage

To provide a consistent user experience RDT stores data to the browser’s local storage. This will enable state rehydration and keep state between page reloads.

To understand which wallet responses that get stored we need to understand the difference between one-time and regular data requests.

One-time data requests do not register the dApp in the wallet and the connect button does not display that data in the UI. The data is meant to be used temporarily by the dApp and discarded thereafter.

A user connecting her wallet will be the first user flow in the majority of dApps. The connect flow is a bit different from subsequent data request flows. Its purpose is to provide the dApp with a minimal amount of user data in order for the user to be able to use the dApp, e.g. the minimal amount of data for a DEX dApp is an account.

RDT handles writing and reading data to the browser’s local storage so that it will be persisted between page loads. The dApp frontend logic can at any time ask RDT to provide the stored data by subscribing to the `state$` observable or calling `requestData`. One time data requests or requests that can not be resolved by the state are sent to the wallet.
